What is data analysis?
Data analysis means working with raw data and transforming it in order to get valuable insights. 

Steps of transforming raw data:
1. Collecting data
2. Cleaning it (remove mistakes, NAs)
3. Exploring and visualizing
4. Organizing it in a clear way
4. Using statistics or algorithms to find patterns. 

The main goal is to understand what the data is telling us and use it to make better decisions or discoveries.

In the modern world we are surrounded by a huge amount of data. Companies, hospitals, governmental establishments, and research institutes all collect a lot of infomation that can be very useful.
Without analysis, this information would too complex to have any value. Therefore, data analysis is a very powerful subject that can help to produce meanungful insights from raw data.


Three areas where data analysis is applied today:

1. Healthcare and Biotechnology
In biology and medicine, data analysis is extremely important.
For example, biotech companies analyze RNA data from saliva or blood samples, which helps to give personal nutrition advice and even detect diseases like cancer at early stages.
In research, we also use data analysis to study gene expression or to check the quality of next-generation sequencing (NGS) results. 
Without data analysis, it would be impossible to handle the huge and complex datasets.

2. Business and Market Intelligence
Companies use data analysis to learn more about their customers, discover new chances to grow, and avoid possible problems. 
For example, banks and financial firms study large amounts of data to catch fraud and to guess how the market might change. 
This helps managers make quicker and smarter decisions.

3. Science
In science data analysis is the core of every decision.
For example, climate reserch scientists collect information from satellites, sensors, and weather stations to track climate change, predict natural disasters, and manage resources like water and energy.
These insights help governments and organizations plan for sustainability and protect ecosystems.

----Conclusion----
From my biology background, I see how data analysis helps scientists turn complex experimental data into knowledge that can improve human health.
In the same way, businesses and technology companies use data to adapt and innovate.
