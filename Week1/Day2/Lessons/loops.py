# LOOPS


# FOR LOOP

# for <variable> in <sequence/iterable>:
    #code that will happen in each iteration

# seq we can loop over it:
# string
# lists
# tuples
# sets
# range

# looping over a string
# for char in "student":
#     print(char)

# # looping over a list
# fruits = ["apple", "watermelon", "banana"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(f"I love {fruit}")

# looping over a range

# print(list(range(1,11,2)))

# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)

# student = "Hermione"
# for i in range(len(student)):
#     if i==5:
#         print(student[i])
        
#while loop
