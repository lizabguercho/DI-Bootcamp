Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses all the requirements outlined in the chapter content. It correctly prompts for user input, validates the string length, prints the first and last characters of a valid string, constructs the string character by character, and shuffles the string as a bonus, perfectly aligning with the instructions.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and comments are used effectively to explain the logic.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given task. It avoids unnecessary computations or complex data structures.
- security: The code does not involve any operations that could pose security risks, such as executing external commands or handling sensitive data.
