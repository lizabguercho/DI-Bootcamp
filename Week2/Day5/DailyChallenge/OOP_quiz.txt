1. Class -  ablueprint that can be used to create an object with specific properties and behaviors.
2. Instance - an item that has all attributes of a Class
3. Encapsulation  means keeping an objectâ€™s data safe by hiding it inside the class and only letting it be changed through controlled methods.
4. Abstraction means showing only the important details of how something works and hiding the unnecessary complexity.
5. Inhertitance - process in which a child class can inherit properties and behaviors of a parent class.
6. Multiple inheritance - inheritance from multiple parent classes at the same time.
7. Polymorphism means the same function or method name can be used in different ways depending on the object that calls it.
8. Method resolution order -is the rule Python uses to decide which method to call first when a class inherits from multiple parents (and they have methods with the same name).
