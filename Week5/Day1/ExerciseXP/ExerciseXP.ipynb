    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates the probability of loan default.\n",
    "When borrower is unable to repay loan within a specific agreed time (90+ days),bankroptcy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Types of Data Needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Applicant details – age, employment, income, dependents, residency, education.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Credit bureau data – credit scores, utilization, bankruptcies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Loan details – amount, term, interest rate, collateral, repayment schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Repayment history – on-time payments, late payments \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Banking/transactional data – inflows/outflows, income stability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sources of Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Internal records from loan origination systems, core banking systems, repayment logs, and customer databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Credit bureaus for external credit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Open Banking APIs or payroll verification services for income and cashflow data\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "By combining internal records, bureau data, and external economic indicators, the project can build a robust dataset to train and evaluate a loan default prediction model."
